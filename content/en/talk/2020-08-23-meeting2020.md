In the middle of 2017, the first R-Ladies chapter in Mexico joined the growing list of R-Ladies chapters around the world. Three years later, 8 more chapters have been created and almost 3,000 members have joined this community in our country. 

This year, 2020, we are joining forces to strengthen ties in the R-Ladies community from all over the country at the First Annual R-Ladies Mexico Meeting.

## Main goals

- Share experiences through an innovative and interactive virtual experience.
- Establish a panel discussion on the perspectives of R-Ladies in our country.
- Empower women to create new chapters in Mexico as a growing community. 
- Organization of speaking engagements and workshops as an opportunity to connect with the community of R users.
