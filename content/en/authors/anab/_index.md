I'm a Ph.D. student at (LIIGH)[https://liigh.unam.mx/], my PI is Alejandra Medina-Rivera.
My project focuses on non-commutable lung diseases, such as Chronic Obstructive
Pulmonary Disease (COPD) and Idiopathic Pulmonary Disease (IPF), with a 
transcriptomic approach. As part of my Ph.D., we have developed (PulmonDB)[http://pulmondb.liigh.unam.mx/].

I like to work with R and Python as much as I can. I also enjoy to help other people so they feel more comfortable with working with those languages. 

My interests are:

- Transcriptomics
- Bioinformatics
- R
- Python
- Single cell RNA-seq
