The first R-Ladies chapter in Mexico born in 2017 as part of the growing up community of R-Ladies Global. Three years later, 7 more chapters have been created and almost 3,000 members have added to this amazing community in our country. 

This year, we want to strengthen efforts among all chapters across the country and bring them together in the First Annual Meeting R-Ladies Mexico.
